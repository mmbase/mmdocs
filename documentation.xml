    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This document will describe in what way MMBase is documented, and how you can contribute to
      updating or adding to the MMBase documentation.
    </para>
    <para>
      There are several sources of documentation and information available. There are a few
      web-sites of the MMBase project (www.mmbase.org, foundation.mmbase.org, design.mmbase.org),
      which do supply knowledge and examples. The examples and HTML documentation which are shipped
      with an MMBase distro are available in the MMBase CVS source repository. The examples pages
      are in the html/mmexamples module, so new examples must be added there.
    </para>
    <para>
      Formal documentation is availabe in the `docbook' XML format in the `documentation' modules of
      the CVS repository.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some older documentation, which was not yet converted or rewritten to the docbook format is
      available in html/mmdocs of CVS.
