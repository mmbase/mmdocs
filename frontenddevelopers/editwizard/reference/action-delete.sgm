		<title>Usage</title>
		<para>This tag defines actions to take when an object is to be removed. there are two possible occurrences of this action: as a top level tag, or as a list-tag.				
		</para>
	</formalpara>
	<para>A top level tag defines an action for when a user issues a delete command from the wizard list page.
	If you define a delete action, list pages will enable the user to remove an object from the MMBase cloud by showing a delete button or link. Not defining this action means the link does not show (thus, objects cannot be deleted if you do not provide the action). Optional children of the action are a roll-over help-description for the link in the list, and a prompt for asking confirmation when the command is issued.
	</para>
	<note><para>Unlike other actions, the top level delete action does not contain an objectstructure - the object deleted is always the current object and its relations. You cannot, for example, define a structure so that deleting the node will automatically delete any related nodes.</para>
	</note>
	<para>A list tag defines an action for when a relation is removed from a list in a form. In general, you need not supply this action - deletes are generally handled automatically. Delete buttons in forms are enabled or disabled by the list tag, not by the delete action. The only time you want to use the delete action in a list is when you want to remove both a relation and the related node. In this case, you can add the delete action, along with the 'additional' objectstructure to delete (besides the relation itself). Currently this 'objectstructure' is only the underlying object, so a delete action will generally look like:
