    system, which is implemented in Java. In its object orientation MMBase
    provides an Object Relation Mapping (ORM), that has much in common with
    Hybernate<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The main difference between Hybernate and MMBase is the way
        relations are treated. In MMBase relations are objects as well, this
        is not the case in Hybernate. To give an example: the relation between
        a team and an member can have a relation to a role object. In this way
        roles of members in a team can be added, changed and removed whenever
        needed. In Hybernate using an object to categorise relations is not
        possible.</p></div>MMBase operates as a web-application which can be plugged-in at
    an application server like Tomcat, Orion, Resin, WebSphere, Jetty or
    IIS.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>The main difference between a webserver like Apache and an
      application server is that an application server is capable of executing
      server-side functionality like programs written in Java. The application
      servers on which MMBase can be plugged in have to support Java and Java
      Server Pages.</p></div><div><img src="media/architecture.png" /></div><p>This document provides an overview of the MMBase architecture. Each
    component in the architecture is described. Suggestions for further
    reading are given. The MMBase architecture can be subdivided into the
    following layers.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Database Access</p></li><li><p>MMBase Core</p></li><li><p>Security</p></li><li><p>Bridge</p></li><li><p>Plugins</p></li><li><p>Components and the Component Framework</p></li><li><p>Applications and Contributions</p></li></ul></div><p>At the end of this document the two main applications build on top
    of MMBase will be discussed: Didactor, the Electronic Learning
    Environment, and the CMS Container, an out-of-the-box portal
    implementation for enterprise content management that complies with the
    JSR 168 portal standard.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N1005D" />2. Database Access</h2></div></div></div><p>MMBase is connected to a database via the JDBC interface. MMBase 1.6
    supports the following relational databases.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Informix</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL</p></li><li><p>MySQL</p></li><li><p>HSQL</p></li><li><p>Oracle</p></li><li><p>DB2</p></li></ul></div><p>A number of features of the MMBase Database layer are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Database transparency</p><p>Ones you've created a database and connected it to MMBase,
        MMBase will do the rest for you. It will take care of the creation of
        tables and will generate and take care of link tables. So the only SQL
        statements which you have to learn to being able to work with MMBase
        are: creating a database, making a backup of a database, restoring a
        database and dropping a database.</p></li><li><p>Automatic index generation</p><p>When MMBase fills your database with tables it automatically
        creates indices for columns, which are known to be frequently used in
        database queries. This will guarantee that the database layer operates
        in an efficient way right from the start.i</p></li></ul></div><p>[TO DO: what do we have to say about Query and Storage? ]</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N10084" />3. MMBase Core</h2></div></div></div><p>MMBase is an object oriented content management system. Content is
    stored in objects. Objects can be connected to other objects by relations.
    These relations are also objects, which can also contain content. Next to
    containing content, objects can also have functionality. E.g. the image
    object has the functionality to convert and scale images. The MMBase Core
    provides the mapping from the relational database layer to the object
    oriented layer. It is capable of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>configuring objects and relations.</p><p>MMBase objects are configured by XML-configuration files called
        builders. These builders describe the fields an object has and its
        functionality. The field names for use in the Graphical User
        Interfaces can be stored in multiple languages to make your MMBase
        implementation ready for use in different languages. After a builder
        is placed in the MMBase installation, the corresponding table in the
        database is automatically created. To learn more about using builders
        check out the Administrators/MMBase Builder Configuration
        documentation . In the MMBase standard builders document under the
        Templaters and Designers section you can find info on the builders
        shipped with the MMBase release.</p></li><li><p>creating objects and relations.</p><p>When an object, or node, is created the functionality added to
        the object can dictate that some action has to be taken. E.g. an email
        which is stored in MMBase is posted.</p><p>The creations of relations is a four-step procedure:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create a builder with the fields that are necessary in the
            relation.</p></li><li><p>Add the relation to the list of relation definitions
            (RelDef)</p></li><li><p>Enter the source-relation-destination information into the
            list of relations types (TypeRel)</p></li><li><p>Create relations.</p></li></ol></div><p>See the document on relations in the Information Analysts
        section for more information on this topic.</p></li><li><p>updating objects and relations.</p><p>MMBase contains observers that listen to changes in objects and
        relations. When a change occurs, an observer can carry out some
        appropriate actions. Most observers are used to keep the MMBase caches
        up to date. Examples of such MMBase caches are the cache with
        converted images and the query cache.</p></li><li><p>retrieving objects and relations.</p><p>When retrieving information from the database, MMBase will store
        the results of the database queries for future use. This cache
        functionality helps to speed up performance. Next to caches for
        database queries, MMBase also contains a cache for storing converted
        images for future use. These caches are totally transparent.</p></li></ul></div><p>[TO DO: write document on Transactions and Multicast.]</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N100B1" />4. Security</h2></div></div></div><p>MMBase offers an elaborated security layer for authorization and
    authentication. Authorization tells what a user is allowed to do.
    Authentication tells how a user can log on to an MMBase website. The
    security models available in MMBase 1.6 are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Cloud Security</p><p>MMBaseusers are administrated in the MMBase object cloud. This
        security model offers a basic ranking system in Anonymous, Users and
        Admin.</p><p>An advantage of the Cloud Security are that you can do your user
        administration via the webinterface and that you are able to integrate
        the MMBase users into your object model.</p></li><li><p>Context Security</p><p>MMBase users are administrated in XML-configuration files on the
        file system. Users are part of Groups and Ranks. Each object in MMBase
        belongs to a context. The Context Security model offers an
        fine-grained mechanisms to specify rights of users and groups in
        different contexts. The model provides the possibility to define basic
        workflow schemes.</p><p>The Context Security is especially fit if the rights of users
        has to be specified on object level or if you need basic workflow
        functionality. A drawback of the context security model is that the
        user administration can not be carried out via the web interface, but
        one has to use the XML-configuration files.</p></li><li><p>Context Cloud Security</p><p>The Context Cloud Security provides the same functionality as
        the Context Security. In contrast to the Context Security, the Context
        Cloud security stores the authentication and authorization information
        in the object cloud.</p><p>The Context Security is especially fit if the rights of users
        has to be specified on object level or if you need basic workflow
        functionality. A drawback of the context security model is that the
        user administration can not be carried out via the web interface, but
        one has to use the XML-configuration files.</p></li><li><p>Basic Security</p><p>Provides the basic login functionality, where users are
        administrated in an file on the file system.</p><p>This security model should only be used in combination with
        MMBase releases before version 1.5, that operate on basis of
        SHTML.</p></li><li><p>No security</p><p>Although trivial, it is sometimes handy to have an MMBase
        installation with no authentication, no authorization or no security
        at all. It won't come as a surprise that MMBase supports this
        functionality.</p></li></ul></div><p>To learn more about security see the The MMBase Security Framework,
    Installing and using Context Security, Installing and using Cloud Security
    in the Administrator section.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N100DA" />5. Bridge (or the MMBase Connection Interface)</h2></div></div></div><p>The MMBase Connection Interface handles the requests from the MMBase
    Plugins and passes them to the Security layer. See the Bridge (MMCI) API
    documentation under Templaters and Designers for more information on this
    topic.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N100DF" />6. Plugins</h2></div></div></div><p>There exist a growing list of plugins which add functionality to the
    MMBase Core. The most important plugins are listed below.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Taglib</p><p>The taglib provides a set of tags which facilitate communication
        between MMBase and JSP-templates. See the MMBase taglib reference and
        the Creating webpages with the MMBase Tag Library in the Templaters
        and Designers section.</p><p>One widely used tool build with the taglib are the JSP-editors
        for MMBase. With MMBase 1.6 to versions of the JSP-editors are
        included \mmeditors\jsp and \mmexamples\jsp\my_editors .</p></li><li><p>Dove</p><p>Dove facilitates communication between MMBase and XML-files. You
        can use Dove to build dynamic MMBase websites based on XML and XSLT.
        See the Dove XML API under the section developers to learn more about
        this topic.</p><p>An important application that uses Dove are the MMBase
        editwizards. The editwizards let you create task-oriented
        user-friendly forms, which can be a big help for editors in working
        with MMBase. See the Editwizards documentation under the Templaters
        and Designers section for more information on creating and using
        editwizard forms.</p></li><li><p>R-MMCI</p><p>The Remote MMBase Cloud Interface makes it possible to
        communicate with different MMBase installation at the same time. This
        powerful plugin makes it possible to share and exchange data between
        MMBase installations irrespective of their location. See the Remote
        MMBase Cloud Interface under the section Developers to find out
        more.</p></li><li><p>XML-importer</p><p>The XML-importer can be used to import data from XML-files into
        MMBase. The XML-importer provides intelligent Find and Merge
        scenario's. More information can be found in the XML Importer (TCP
        2.0) documentation in the Developers section.</p></li><li><p>Application tool</p><p>With the MMBase application tool the objects and relations used
        in an MMBase installation can be specified in XML and data from an
        application can be exported to or imported from XML. Most of the times
        data model or object model is used to denote the specification of the
        objects and relations present in an installation. In MMBase also the
        term object cloud is used. For more information on this tool see the
        Information Analysts section in the MMBase documentation. The object
        model for use by the Application tool can be generated by UML2MMBase
        and MMBase2UML. <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://mmapps.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://mmapps.sourceforge.net/</a></p></li><li><p>Editwizards</p><p>The editwizards provide the functionality to define forms to
        edit the MMBase object cloud. Editors who do not frequently use MMBase
        might get lost in their MMBase object cloud, when using the default
        JSP editors to enter or change content, With the editwizards it is
        possible to build task oriented forms, which guide editors through
        their work. See the editwizard userguide and reference manual in the
        templaters section for more information on the editwizards.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N1010A" />7. Applications and Contributions</h2></div></div></div><p>An application is a website or functionality that is build on top of
    MMBase. An application uses the plugins mentioned in the previous sections
    or accesses the MMBase bridge directly via the API. The MMBase
    distribution provides a number of example applications. See the link at
    the end of this paragraph. Lets have a look at the MyNews application as
    an example. The object model of the MyNews application can be found in
    application/mynews/config/MyNews.xml. The definition of the objects and
    relations used in MyNews.xml can be found in
    application/mynews/config/MyNews/builders. The
    application/mynews/config/MyNews/ directory itself contains some sample
    data that is imported when the application is installed. The templates
    that use the taglib plugin to show the newsitems in the website can be
    found in the application/mynews/templates directory. <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://cvs.mmbase.org/viewcvs/applications/" target="_top">http://cvs.mmbase.org/viewcvs/applications/</a></p><p>A contribution is much the same as an application, The only real
    difference is that an application is maintained by the MMBase community
    and is an official part of the MMBase distribution, whereas a contribution
    is maintained by a third party. Use the link at the end of the paragraph
    to get an overview over the contributions. At the end of this document two
    of the main contributions will be described: Didactor and the CMS
    Container. <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://cvs.mmbase.org/viewcvs/contributions/" target="_top">http://cvs.mmbase.org/viewcvs/contributions/</a></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N10117" />8. Components and the component framework</h2></div></div></div><p>With the upcoming release 1.9 of MMBase the component framework will
    become available. The component framework adds component based development
    to MMBase. To integrate an already available component into a website in
    the MMBase releases prior to 1.9, you had to: (a) change all urls
    generated by the component to make sure all necessary information was
    posted to the right page, (b) change the layout of component so that the
    layout fits the layout of the website and (c) write code to let other
    components know a new component is integrated, so they can respond to its
    presence.</p><p>By using the component framework a component can be integrated
    without the need to make a change to it. For more information see the
    documentation on the component framework in the backend developers section
    of the documentation.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N1011E" />9. Didactor</h2></div></div></div><p>Didactor is an e-Learning software platform (ELO) that is build on
    top of MMBase. With an ELO educational content can be provided to students
    together with all necessary tooling to follow courses online, make
    assessments and develop competencies. <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-learning</a></p><p>A special feature of Didactor is that it uses the MMBase treepart /
    leafpart functionality. By this default functionality can be adjusted on
    each desired level by just placing files. Didactor already makes use of an
    early version of the MMBase component framework and it contains the
    following components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>address</p><p>list of contacts for use with Didactor email and agenda</p></li><li><p>agenda</p><p>allows students to make individual, workgroup and class

    management, which complies with the JSR 168 portal standard. The CMS
    Container can be run in a single webapp mode where every change in the
    content is visible on the website immediately. Or it can be run in a mode
    where two webapps are used: one for editing content and one for showing
    the content on the website. On the editing or staging webapp the pages can
    be previewed before the content is published to the live webapp. The
    functionality of the CMS Container is split in two parts: the modules and
    the portlets. The portlets provide the functionality for the website. The
    modules provide the functionality for the editor environment. For more
