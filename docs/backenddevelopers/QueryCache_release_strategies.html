Each time a
    peace of information can be retrieved from a cache some more costly
    operation becomes unnessecary, like reading from a database. MMBase has
    quite a lot of caches in use (it varies a bit from release to release),
    but there are principally two kinds: query result caches and all the
    others. The query result caches cache (surprise!) the result sets of
    various types of queries, and they are the subject of this
    document.</p><p>So the better these caches work, the less often expansive database
    reads have to be done, and the more rapidly MMBase can respond to
    requests. The degree to which a cache works 'well' can be seen as the
    degree to which a cache can keep it's information during changes in the
    dataset it buffers. When this data changes, the cache will somehow have to
    decide what the consequence of this change is for each of it's entries. So
    the more intelligently a cache can assess these changes, and the less
    often data is flushed from the cache unnecessarily, the better a cache
    works. For a more detailed explanation of how the MMBase query caches work
    see Appendix A.</p><p>MMBase has a data model who's strength lies in flexibility rather
    than performance. Also, MMBase tends to create a lot of queries, that are
    system generated (read: generic) and not performance optimized. When your
    MMBase website begins to draw serious visitors, and for some reason nodes
    that are being read a lot are being updated a lot as well, and you want to
    show these changes right away, database load can become a serious issue,
    and cache performance becomes vital. For this reason it used to be so that
    applications like forums or even polls could be challenging against a
    great load with MMBase. The query caches were not able to make good
    judgments about what changes in the data should cause flushes on what
    cache entries, with far to many flushes as consequence, and far to many
    queries on the database, leading to poor performance. The 'query cache
    release strategy project' was created to address this problem.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="features" />2. Goals</h2></div></div></div><p>In this project we actually had two goals. First we wanted to
    improve the query caches by making them 'smarter', so they could evaluate
    node and relation changes better. We were going to do that by introducing
    a set of rules that could analyze the events and determine if a query
    result set needs to be flushed on account of them.</p><p>But we also wanted to provide the means to easily and flexibly add
    rules to caches, so application developers can optimize their specific
    data models with custom rules. An example: Think of a forum. Usually there
    are threads and posts. When a post is added to a specific thread, all
    queries that query the posts of that specific thread should be flushed
    from the cache, and those alone. It would be hard to create a generic rule
    for this kind of optimization. This parent-child relation does not exist
    between all node types that are related, and it is hard to guess. So it
    would be a good idea for the developer of the forum to create a custom
    rule that checks the (parent) thread of all posts that generate a node
    event, and match that thread against the constraints of the queries in the
    cache, to see if the changed forum post applies to it. If not, don't
    flush.</p><p>So we wanted a system that would allow others to easily create
    custom cache invalidation rules (from now on called strategies). We also
    wanted to be able to dynamically load and unload strategies, and we wanted
    to be able to see some statistics for each strategy on the system, he
    MMBase admin &gt; tools &gt; cache jsp page being the designated place to
    access statistics and functionality of the release strategies.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="architecture" />3. Architecture</h2></div></div></div><p>To achieve this a small framework was created, and inserted at the
    base of all query result caches: org.mmbase.cache.QueryResultCache. All
    strategies are subclasses of the abstract class ReleaseStrategy. This
    class provides some services in the nature of performance tracking, so you
    can show some statistics for every strategy. It also contains a growing
    collection of utility methods that are there to help you investigate query
    objects. For more detail, check out the api docs.</p><p>One of the first implementations was ChainedReleaseStrategy. This
    class is basically a wrapper class for a collection of strategies, with
    functionality to dynamically add and remove strategies. This class is
    actually the default strategy for every query cache, and is always loaded
    with the default strategy(s). Which the default strategies are will change
    over time, and the default strategies themselves will also get better over
    time, as more rules are added. Currently there are two global strategies
    that are always loaded:</p><div><img src="media/release_strategy.png" /></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="N10051" />3.1. BetterStrategy</h3></div></div></div><p>This strategy, in spite of it's lousy name, performs quite a
      number of checks on queries to discover if a node/relation event
      actually applies to it, and so prevents a major amount of un necessary
      cache flushes. Here are some examples of the things this strategy
      checks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If a node is new, and the query has more steps than one: don't
          flush. A new node has no relations yet, so can not be part of the
          dataset of a query over more tables than one.</p></li><li><p>If the event is a relation event. Check if the source type,
          role and destination type actually occur in the query. If not: don't
          flush (a relation event is received by an Observer if that
          observer's type matches either source type or destination type of
          the relation event, so most of these events are bound to have no
          full match with the queries of this Observer.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="N1005D" />3.2. ConstraintsMatchingStrategy</h3></div></div></div><p>This strategy goes one step further. If the BetterStrategy can not
      find reason not to flush a query, the ConstraintsMatchingStrategy will
      try to find a constraint in the query for the step that matches the
      event. then it checks the values of the changed node against those
      constraints to see if now falls within the query where it did not before
      or the other way around (for more information about query objects take a
      look at the SeachQuery documentation).</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="interfaces" />4. Roll your own</h2></div></div></div><p>To add your own strategy class you have to do two things: Create the
    class and deploy it.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="N10068" />4.1. Creation</h3></div></div></div><p>To create your own strategy class you have to extend
      ReleaseStrategy and override it's abstract method doEvaluate(NodeEvent
      event, SearchQuery query, List cachedResult) (This is not the method
      actually called by the query cache, but it is a template method. The
      method evaluate(NodeEvent event, SearchQuery query, List cachedResult),
      which is called by the cache should not be overridden, because it takes
      care of the statistics gathering business). Here you define your
      specific rules.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="N1006D" />4.2. Deployment</h3></div></div></div><p>Then you have to deploy it. Make sure the class is on the class
      path of your application server and add and entry in the configuration
      file caches.xml, to configure which of the query caches are loaded with
      your strategy (the strategies are loaded in the order they are listed).
      If the query cache that you want to configure with your cache is not
      listed in caches.xml, just add an entry for it.</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;cache name="MultilevelCache"&gt;
    &lt;strategy name=”org.something.mystrategy”/&gt;
    &lt;status&gt;active&lt;/status&gt;
    &lt;size&gt;300&lt;/size&gt;
&lt;/cache&gt;</pre><p>It is also possible to configure for a strategy to be loaded on
      all query caches. Just add it in the top of the configuration file, just
      below the &lt;caches&gt; element.</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;caches&gt;
    &lt;releaseStrategies&gt;
        &lt;strategy&gt;org.something.mystrategy&lt;/strategy&gt;
    &lt;/releaseStrategies&gt;</pre><p>Then after starting up MMBase you can go to [url to your
      mmbase]mmbase/admin/. Then choose 'tools' and then 'cache'. Here you can
      see how your query caches are performing. You can monitor the cost
      (processing time in milliseconds) and performance (queries evaluated and
      flushes prevented). Of every strategy on every individual query cache.
      You can also disable your strategy here.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="abstract_classes" />5. Strategies and MMBase clusters</h2></div></div></div><p>It is possible to make strategies that do very elaborate checks,
    which can in turn become rather costly in terms of CPU. It could well be
    that you are overshooting your target when this happens. One interesting
    point though is that mmbase applications are easily up scaled through
    clustering. This is not necessarily the same for your database
    application. So in some situations it could well make sense to do very
    costly checking on the application server layer to avoid some extra
    queries on the database.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="classes" />6. Appendix A: QueryResultCache</h2></div></div></div><p>The QueryResultCache is the base class for all caches that store
    queries and their result sets. It has a static inner class called
    Observer. An Observer listens to the node events of a specific type of
    builder. When a query is cached, all steps are iterated over, and if an
    Observer instance for the type of that step does not exist, it is created.
    Then the query is registered with this Observer instance. This creates a
    matrix where a query is registered with all the observers that correspond
    to it´s steps, and an Observer hold reference to all queries containing a
    step of it´s type.</p><p>When an observer receives a node event, it Iterates over all queries
    it holds reference to, evaluates if the query should be flushed, and then
    removes it from the cache.</p><div><img src="http://www.mmbase.org/mmdocs/backenddevelopers/media/QueryResultCache.jpg" /></div></div></div><hr xmlns="" /><p xmlns="">
