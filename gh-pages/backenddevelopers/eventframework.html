    release strategy project. Because the current MMBase node events yield to
    little information for advanced query invalidation rules, we needed a more
    detailed node and relation change event. NodeEvent and RelationEvent
    objects were introduced to cover this.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="architecture" />2. Architecture</h2></div></div></div><p>The core of the system is the EventManager. A singleton instance of
    this class is instantiated at startup time. This event manager is being
    loaded with brokers for a number of (MMBase) events. These are: NodeEvent,
    RelationEvent, and Event (by means of the AllEventBroker, used by the
    clustering application). If you want MMBase to load other event brokers as
    well, add them to the cluster manager configuration file eventManager.xml
    in the config directory. The event manager manages the brokers (one for
    each event type), and accepts listeners for these event types, as well as
    events (of any supported type) to pass on to the brokers. The event
    manager tries to find an event broker for every listener that is
    registered with it, and passes it on to the broker (that actually manages
    the listeners for it's event type`). are So what happens when an event is
    fired? 1 some code calls EventManager.propagateEvent(Event event). All
    event classes need to extend from event, so it can be any event. 2 the
    event manager iterates over it's event brokers, and asks each one if it
    can broker for this event (which mean it can deliver it to the right
    listeners. 3 The event broker (a specialization of AbstractEventBroker)
    calls canBrokerForEvent(Event event), (one of AbstractEventBroker's
    abstract methods you have to override to create an actual broker) to
    discover if this event is for him. 4 if so, the broker iterates over it's
    listeners, and propagates the event.</p><div><img src="media/eventframework.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="roll_your_own" />3. Roll your own event type</h2></div></div></div><p>It is easy to add your own type of event. These can be MMBase
    related events or events that are pertinent to some application/extension
    you created. The great bonus is that your events are delivered across your
    mmbase cluster.</p><p>For every type of event you have to have two classes and one
    interface: an EventBroker, an Event and an EventListener interface.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="create_Event" />3.1. Event</h3></div></div></div><p>Your event class has to extend org.mmbase.core.event.Event. This
      serves as a base type and also keeps track of the location in the
      cluster that the event originated from. One of the big advantages of
      using MMBase to send your application events is that they are send to
      all mmbase nodes in your network (that are configured to receive each
      others multicast messages), so it is more easy to write scalable web
      applications. (See for more information the document about mmbase
      clustering). To take advantage of this you have to make shure that the
      event is serializable though.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="create_EventListener" />3.2. EventListener</h3></div></div></div><p>The EventListener interface has to extend
      org.mmbase.core.event.EventListener. It has to define one method that
      will be called by your event broker. (so what ever method name you
      choose is up to you, just make sure it accepts an instance of your event
      object and your event broker calls it).</p><p>Every class that wants to be notified of your type of event has to
      implement this interface and implement it's methods.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="create_EventBroker" />3.3. EventBroker</h3></div></div></div><p>First you need a broker for you event type. The function of an
      event broker is to manage all listeners for your event type. It also
      determines for the event manager if it can handle an event. Event
      brokers have to be registered with the event manager. This is all you
      have to do to make it accept listeners for your event type, and notify
      them.</p><p>To create your own event broker simply extend AbstractEventBroker
      and implement the abstract methods. For an example it is a good idea to
      take a look ad NodeEventBroker.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="N1005F" />4. Node and relation events: what has changed</h2></div></div></div><p>This section tells you what you need to know about node and relation
    changes, how to use them, and how they all bounce and bounce inside MMBase
    these days.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="N10064" />4.1. Classes and interfaces</h3></div></div></div><p>This section tells you what you need to know about node and
      relation changes, how to use them, and how they all bounce and bounce
      inside MMBase these days.</p><p>Some things have changed in respect to the previous implementation
      using the org.mmbase.module.core.MMBaseObserver interface. This
      interface provided different methods for local and remote node changes.
      It was felt that this is not very useful; the usual practice seems to be
      to create one method to handle both types of events. It is still
      possible to determine if an event was local or remote by comparing the
      machine name of the event to the local one.</p><p>On the other hand was the information about the event provided to
      these methods very poor. This was the main motivation to change the
      event model.</p><p>The new org.mmbase.core.event.NodeEventListener and
      org.mmbase.core.event.RelationEventListener interfaces create a
      distinction between node and relation events. The classes
      org.mmbase.core.event.NodeEvent and org.mmbase.core.event.RelationEvent
      (and through them the events) provide much more information than
      before.</p><p>When you register a NodeEventListener or a RelationEventListener
      with the EventManager all node or relation events are propagated to it.
      This is many times what you want. In stead you want to listen to the
      events for nodes of a specific type. To make it as easy as it was before
      to register listeners to node and/or relation events of a specific
      builder, Some wrapper classes were created for NodeEventListener and
      RelationEventListener instances, that will filter the events for you
      (take a look at org.mmbase.core.event.TypedNodeEventListenerWrapper and
      org.mmbase.core.event.TypedRelationEventListenerWrapper. But you don't
      even have to use those directly. Both the MMBase and MMObjectBuilder
      classes have convenience methods to register your listeners. Take a look
      at Mmbase.addNodeRelatedEventsListener(String builder, Object listener)
      and MMObjectBuilder.addEventListener(Object listener). The object is
      your class implementing either NodeEventListener or
      RelationEventListener or both (discovered through introspection).
      Wrappers are created accordingly and registered as listeners.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="N10071" />4.2. Node and relation event flow</h3></div></div></div><p>This section provides insight into what happens when node and
      relation events are fired.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="N10076" />4.2.1. Local node change</h4></div></div></div><p>This section describes what happens when a local node or
        releation changes.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Nodes are committed to the database by the StorageManager.
            When this has happened ChangeManager.commit() is called. Just as
            the StorageManager is there to handle all changes to the database
            when a node changes, the ChangeManager has this responsibility
            towards MMBase (i.e. Make sure every 'client' that needs to know
            about the change does do).</p></li><li><p>The ChangeManager creates a NodeEvent instance and
            propagates it to the EventManager. If the changed node is a
            specialization of Insrel, a RelationEvent is subsequently created
            and propagated to the EventManager
            (EventManager.propagateEVent(Event)).</p></li><li><p>The EventManager will find the brokers that can handle
            events of this type, and the event will be propagated to the
            broker's listeners. In case of a node or relation event, those
            include the builder matching the type of the event, the Obsterver
            instance for the event type. Mind you, for a node event the 'type'
            of the event is the builder of the node, while for a relation
            event it's type is both the relation source type as the relation
            destination type. The ClusterManager will receive the event
            regardless of it's type.</p></li><li><p>The builder (all builders implement the NodeEventListener
            and the RelationEventListener) receiving the event will update
            it's node caches.</p><p>The Observer receiving the event will iterate over all
            queries it holds reference to and evaluate the event against it to
            discover it the query must be flushed (for more information about
            QueryCache#Observer see the 'QueryCache Release Strategy'
            document).</p><p>The ClusterManager implements the AllEventListener, so it
            will be notified for any and all event types. It will first check
            if the event is local. If this is so, it will serialize the event,
            and send it across the network to other nodes in the MMBase
            cluster.</p></li></ol></div><div><img src="media/eventflow-send.jpg" /></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="N1008E" />4.2.2. Remote node change</h4></div></div></div><p>This section describes what happens when a node changes

              them and sending them into the network.</p></li></ol></div></p><div><img src="media/eventflow-receive.jpg" /></div></div></div></div></div><hr xmlns="" /><p xmlns="">
