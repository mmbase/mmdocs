                An 'mmbase application' is a modular piece of
                functionality, which can contain code (jars, classes), templates
                and a piece of an object model, with possbily some data, and
                other resources. A tool implemented with MMBase means.
              </p><p>This thing is also called 'package' by some.</p><p>This functionality was never quite finished. In MMBase 1.9 we talk about 'components'</p></li><li><p>In the 'apps1' framework, 'application' refers to only the
              object model and data.</p></li><li><p>An 'authentication application' is one of the handlers -
              identified by a string - of a certain security {authentication}
              implementation, to deal with a authentication request. Most
              security implementations support a 'name/password', a 'class'
              and an 'anonymous' authentication application, but these modules
              can be pluggable, and some implementations allow for a unlimited
              number of these. In taglib this is shorthanded to
              'authentication' rather then to 'application' (meant is the
              attribute of the mm:cloud tag).</p></li><li><p>Copied from WordNet: a program that gives a computer

              &lt;config&gt;/modules (which contains only key/value
              properties). Modules were more important in the SCAN era, where
              they provided all kind of auxiliary functionality. Nowadays they
              mainly provide a way to plug things in the bootstrap of MMBase
              accompanied with a convenient way of customization.</p></li><li><p>When talking about CVS, a 'module' is a kind of main entry
              of the repository. The MMBase CVS repository currently has the
              following modules: src (core java classes), documentation
              (docbook sources), html (general content for the mmbase distro),
              config (example configuration) and applications (components
              supported by the community).</p></li><li><p>An independent piece of software which forms part of one
              or more larger programs. Different languages have different
              concepts of a module but there are several common ideas.</p><p>Modules are usually compiled separately (in compiled
              languages) and provide an abstraction or information hiding
              mechanism so that a module's implementation can be changed
              without requiring any change to other modules. In this respect
              they are similar to objects in an object-oriented language,
              though a module may contain many procedures and/or functions
              which would correspond to many objects.</p><p class="remark"><i><span class="remark">Definition copied from The Free On-line Dictionary of

            The effect is that mmbase configuration files can be present in jars, in WEB-INF/config
            or both. Or even in the database. The admin-pages provide an overview, to check how a

          reldef object). This role could then be used to allow relations
          between news and people.</p><p>The most often roles are `related' and `posrel', which both
          lack any real-life semantics.</p><p>Two `related' nodes are just that. Two `posrel' related nodes
          are also just related, but to the posrel role normally the `posrel'
          relation builder is associated, which allows for one extra field in
          the relations; the `pos' field with integer type, which makes it
