                     MMBase 1.9.0 - Upgrade Notes
===================================================================

============
INTRODUCTION:
============

This document describes the steps required to upgrade an existing (1.8)
MMBase-installation. Please make sure you have a backup of all
important files (webapp, database) before upgrading.

- MMBase 1.9.0 requires java 1.5 to build. We recommend using a 1.5 JVM too.
  (I'm not sure whether that is absolutely necessary)

- Replace all mmbase.jar's with new jars.
  New jar's have new filenames, so be sure to delete the old ones. 

- Replace and/or install all shipped jsp files too.
   - Important is the /mmbase directory with generic editors and admin-pages.
     The complete mmbase admin environment is renewed.

   - If you need the examples you should replace /mmexamples with the new
     mmexamples directory.

   - The editwizard jsp and xsls are shipped in /mmbase/edit/wizard
     (used to be /mmapps/editwizard). You can also download them
     separately in mmbase-editwizard.zip now.

- Copy and/or merge configuration files from /WEB-INF/config. 
  The mmbase jar's contain all configuration files with default settings,
  including builders and data if needed.

- Clean the working directory of your app-server (to recompile jsp's).

- Check the releasenotes.txt for know issues and changes.
