    <section>
      <title>What is RMMCI?</title>

      <para>To be able to understand RMMCI some basic knowledge about java,
      MMBase and the MMBase Cloud Interface is required. Lets try to do this
      in a few line. MMBase is a object / relation object management system.
      Object instances in MMBase are known as nodes. They Are much like other
      (java)objects they have data members and behavior. Each nodes has a
      type. The type or as mmbase calls it node manager defines what behavior
      and data members a node may have. A node manager is a combination of a
      java class and an xml configuration. In java term the node manager with
      nodes is much like a container managed entity bean (but better). A
      strong aspect of MMBase is the way it handle relations. The difference
      between a java object and an MMBase node is that the nodes are
      persistent. The combination of the object and node managers is called the
      cloud.</para>

      <para>The MMBase cloud is an abstract definition the of world that
      MMBase knows. An MMBase cloud can run distributed over multiple
      machines.</para>

      <para>The MMBase Cloud Interface (MMCI) is a java interface that
      provides access to the MMBase cloud. The interface is defined in the
      java package org.mmbase.bridge. There are currently 2 implementations of
      the MMCI. on known as the local implementation and one known as the
      remote implementation. The local implementation uses the mmbase core
      packages to implement the bridge interface. The remote implementation
      (what this document is about) is a wrapper around the local
      implementation that makes it possible to access a cloud instance from a
      &#34;remote&#34; location.</para>

      <para>Since an MMBase cloud can run distributed over multiple
      machines/instances why use RMMCI? Well running multiple MMBase instances
      can be to much for what you want. If you just want to connect to a cloud
      ant change some nodes of install new node types RMMCI is what you are
      looking for. An other reasons for using RMMCI is that is also makes is
      possible to connect to multiple MMBase clouds and send data
      over(agents).</para>

      <para>RMMCI stand for Remote MMBase Cloud Interface, RMMCI is a set of
      java files that makes it possible to connect to an MMBase cloud using
      the MMCI (MMBase Cloud Interface) without the need to start a own MMBase
      Cloud instance.</para>

      <title>Using BeanShell</title>

			<para>RMMCI allows scripting. get mmbase-rmmci.jar from /WEB-INF/lib . Download <ulink url="http://www.beanshell.org/">http://www.beanshell.org/</ulink>
      (in the example bsh-1.2b7.jar was downloaded) copy both files to a
      directory and create a files called bshdemo.bsh with the content of this
      listing. If now you make the program executable (chmod 755 bshdemo.bsh)
      and run the program you will have created and run your first RMMCI
      BeanShell script.</para>

      <programlisting>#!/bin/sh
#! The following hack allows java to reside anywhere in the PATH.
//bin/sh -c &#34;exec java -classpath bsh-1.2b7.jar bsh.Interpreter $0 $*&#34;; exit
addClassPath(&#34;mmbase-rmmci.jar&#34;);
import org.mmbase.bridge.*;

cloud = ContextProvider.getCloudContext(&#34;rmi://127.0.0.1:1111/remotecontext&#34;).getCloud(&#34;mmbase&#34;);
list = cloud.getNodeManager(&#34;mmservers&#34;).getList(null,null,null);

      <title>BeanShell, a more realistic example</title>
	 <para>The previous example of course is not very usefull. Here we wil show how to use rmmci so that mmbase can recieve mail on a unix box. with unix you can forward your mail to a program this is usualy done with a .forward file. here is content of my example .forward file

      <title>RMI over HTTP</title>

      <para>If your application has to be accessed via the internet your
      probably need to use the HTTP protocol for communication between the
      client and server. While again this is not very good for performance it
      is possible. MMBase provides a servlet that acts a a HTTP to rmi gateway
      servlet org.mmbase.servlet.rmi.RMIHandlerServlet (it is a drop in
      replacement for the java-rmi.cgi provided with the java jdk) . make the
      servlet available under the /cgi-bin/java-rmi.cgi servlet mapping</para>

      <programlisting><![CDATA[

    <title>RMMCI implementation details</title>

    <section>
      <title>RMMCI uses the MMCI Local implementation</title>

      <para>This document describes the technical architecture behind the
      Remote MMBase Cloud Interface and how it&#39;s build process works</para>

      <para>Developers of the MMBase community have created an interface
      called MMBase Cloud Interface (MMCI). This interface is a Java Interface
      (as in interface classes). Using the MMCI it is possible to access most
      of the features of MMBase. The interface is there to provide abstraction
      between how MMBase is implemented (database/Java code) and the outside
      world. Using the interface it is possible to access different parts of
      MMBase, the cloud, transactions, node managers, nodes, modules etc...
      Until now there was only one implementation of the MMCI known as the
      &#34;LocalContext&#34; implementation. This Local MMCI implementation
      uses core MMBase classes to implement the MMCI and is widely used. An
      example of functionality that is created on top of the MMCI is the JSP
      tag library. RMMCI uses the decorator pattern to intercept every call to
      the MMCI, sends the call over a network(using RMI) and at server side
      RMMCI calls the &#34;LocalContext&#34; implementation.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The current MMBase MMCI architecture</title>

      <para>The MMCI interface provides access to the MMBase cloud. The MMCI
      interface is defined in the package org.mmbase.bridge. Examples of such
      definitions are the <ulink
      url="http://www.mmbase.org/development/api/1.7/org/mmbase/bridge/Cloud.html">org.mmbase.bridge.Cloud</ulink>
      and the <ulink
      url="http://www.mmbase.org/development/api/1.7/org/mmbase/bridge/Node.html">org.mmbase.bridge.Node</ulink>
      interface. Depending on your configuration a security model is chosen.
      the MMCI implementation (LocalContext) interfaces with the core MMBase
      classes.</para>

      <para>RMMCI adds a network layer to the MMCI by re-implementing the MMCI
      and using the current MMCI implementation.</para>

      <title>How the RMMCI code generation works</title>

      <para>RMMCI uses Remote Method Invocation(RMI). To use RMI it is
      required to write an interface that extends java.rmi.Remote and every
      method in the class should throw RemoteException. Since we have an
      existing interface we decided to create a <emphasis>new</emphasis>
      interface based on the current one but that extended the java.rmi.Remote
      interface and throws RemoteExceptions. We also decided to generate the
      <emphasis>new</emphasis> interface. The first step is to create a XML
      description of the current interface. this is done in a class found in
      org.mmbase.bridge.remote.generator.MMCI that class uses ClassToXML also
      found in org.mmbase.bridge.remote.generator.ClassToXML. the resulting
      XML file <filename>MMCI.xml</filename> look like this:</para>

      <programlisting>

    ..........
&#60;/mmci&#62;
      </programlisting>

      <para>based on this XML file
      org.mmbase.bridge.remote.generator.RemoteGenerator creates the
      interface. for example org.mmbase.bridge.Cloud becomes
      org.mmbase.bridge.remote.RemoteCloud</para>

      <programlisting>
public interface RemoteCloud extends  Remote {
   public java.lang.String getName() throws RemoteException;
   public java.lang.String getDescription() throws RemoteException;
......
      </programlisting>

      <para>for every MMCI interface class RemoteGenerator also create 2 more
      classes. One implementation of the RemoteCloud
      (org.mmbase.bridge.remote.rmi.RemoteCloud_Rmi</para>

      <programlisting>
public class RemoteCloud_Rmi extends  UnicastRemoteObject implements RemoteCloud  {
  Cloud originalObject;
      public java.lang.String getName() throws RemoteException{
         return originalObject.getName();
   }
      </programlisting>

      <para>and</para>

      <programlisting>
public class RemoteCloud_Impl implements Cloud  {
   //original object
   RemoteCloud originalObject;
   public java.lang.String getName() {

         return originalObject.getName();
      } catch (Exception e){throw new RuntimeException(e.getMessage());}
   }
}
      </programlisting>

      <para>The last class implements the original interface and uses the
      RemoteInterface for network traffic. The RemoteCloud_Rmi should be
      compiled using the java rmic</para>

      <para>The final picture looks like this:</para>

      <para>We now have 2 implementation of the MMCI

      <title>Security concerns</title>

      <para>RMMCI provides a very powerful tool to update MMBase cloud
      remotely, not only for you but also for persons that should not be able
      to update your content. MMBase has a security module that can provide a
      user/password protection on your data. This is the minimal security you
      should take. A standard MMBase build has security turned off. The
      current security module does not protect access to MMBase modules (like
      the admin module).</para>

      <para>The communication between MMBase clouds and the RMMCI client is
      not encrypted, serialized objects are sent over the network. There is
      work in progress to use SSL.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Integration process</title>

      <para>The classes currently using the MMCI call LocalContext directly
      therefore will not be able to access RMMCI. Support for multiple
      implementations of the bridge interface is provided by means of the
      ContextProvider class. This class should be used in order to be able to
      run programs local and remote.</para>

      <para>Sun has been very smart and decided that with java 1.4 it was a good idea to change the way objects are serialized.
